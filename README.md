# :brain: Brain Tumor Classification Project 
This is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for tumor classification based on MRI scans. Developed as a part of a Kaggle competition, this project also serves as a fun and enriching practice for diving into the world of machine learning and image classification. This repository holds all the necessary code and files for reproducing the project's results.

## :target: Project Overview 
This project aims at constructing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that is capable of tumor classification based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. The VGG-16 model was leveraged and evaluated on the basis of accuracy, serving as the primary metric for gauging model performance. The processing flow involved preprocessing of the dataset, training the models, evaluation of their performance, and possible tuning of hyperparameters. The ultimate aim is to identify the most effective model for accurately classifying tumor and non-tumor subjects. This project is not only part of a Kaggle competition, but also a great opportunity for practice and learning in the field of machine learning and image classification.

## :book: Data Set Description 

The project deploys the 'Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection' dataset, which is composed of MRI scans sorted into two classes:

1. 'NO': Denotes scans with no presence of a tumor, represented as '0'. 
2. 'YES': Denotes scans with presence of a tumor, represented as '1'. 

However, it's important to note that the dataset does not come with specific details regarding the origin and other related aspects of the MRI scans.
